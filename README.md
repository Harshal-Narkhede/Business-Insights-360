# 🌐 Business Insights 360 – Power BI Analytics for AtliQ Hardware
Business Insights 360 is a unified Power BI dashboard that delivers a complete view of AtliQ’s business performance. It integrates finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive perspectives into one platform, enabling stakeholders to monitor KPIs, identify risks, and make data-driven decisions.
The fiscal year runs from September to August, and all metrics are aligned accordingly.

# 🏢 Company Overview
AtliQ Hardware is a rapidly growing company in the computer hardware industry, expanding globally through retailers, direct sales, and distributors. The company has experienced strong growth in recent years, but its reliance on Excel-based reporting limited timely decision-making and KPI tracking. To strengthen competitiveness and sustain profitability, AtliQ began transitioning toward modern analytics.

# 📝 Problem Statement
Despite growth, AtliQ faced declining performance in Latin America and suffered losses after opening a new store in America based on intuition and limited data. Competitors with advanced analytics teams were outperforming them, exposing the risks of outdated reporting methods. The absence of real-time insights across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain created inefficiencies and missed opportunities

# 🎯 Project Objective

- The dashboard empowers leadership to compare actuals vs targets, track performance trends, and identify growth opportunities.
- By consolidating KPIs into one platform, the project enables smarter, faster, and data-driven decision-making to sustain growth and remain competitive.
